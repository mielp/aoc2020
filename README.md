# Advent of code 2020

Hey! This repository will store my answers for the
[advent of code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

I used JavaScript as the language I'm most comfortable
with for iterating quickly and solving this kind of problems.

Not all of these answers will be _good_, but sometimes
I'll do the extra work of making them worth reading.
For instance, I really like my answer for day 1, so I wrote documentation.

## How to run

```
node day.mjs <DAY> [PART]
```

Will print the answers for the given day.
If the part is not specified, it will print both parts.
